# Forms Builder
When I first heard about a [shadCN form builder](https://www.shadcn-form.com/), I wanted to build one myself too. So it took me a few days to set this project up. The project is basically what it says you can build forms using a GUI and it'll automatically generate a code for you. I wanted to take it a step up and make it for all frameworks and libraries. However, for now all that my app can do is plain HTML, no CSS, or with tailwindCSS, with and without typescript, with and without react, with and without react hook forms and shadCN library.

Check this out and let me know what y'all think about this. I plan to make this better by adding other frameworks like Vue, Svelte, Angular, etc. However, I do not know these frameworks so it might take some time. Although if anyone of you who knows these frameworks and is interested in helping me, I'll be grateful. Hope this helps the community. Happy coding!!!
